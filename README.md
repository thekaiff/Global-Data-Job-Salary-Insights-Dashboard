## 🧭 Executive Summary

In today’s competitive data-driven job market, professionals often struggle to understand if their compensation truly reflects market standards.
To address this, I developed an Excel-based Data Jobs Salary Dashboard that analyzes real-world 2023 salary data for Data Scientists, Analysts, and Engineers across countries.

---

## 💼 Business Problem

With global demand for data professionals skyrocketing, compensation packages vary significantly across regions and job types.
Job seekers often accept offers below market value due to the lack of transparent salary data.
Similarly, HR teams face difficulty setting competitive pay scales aligned with skill levels and market standards.

This project was designed to answer key questions:

- What are the median salaries across popular data-related roles?

- How do location and job type (remote/full-time/contract) affect compensation?

- Which skills and roles command the highest pay?

## 🔍 Methodology

### Approach:

I conducted **descriptive salary analysis** using Excel’s analytical capabilities — focusing on **data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization** to uncover salary trends.

### Key Analytical Steps:

**Data Preparation:** Cleaned and validated 2023 data science job dataset (removed duplicates, handled nulls, standardized currencies).

**Exploratory Analysis:** Used formulas (MEDIAN, IF, SEARCH, FILTER) to compute median salaries by job title, country, and work type.

**Visualization:** Designed an interactive Excel dashboard with bar charts, map charts, and validated dropdown filters for real-time exploration.

### Why Excel?

Excel remains a powerful yet accessible tool for rapid business analysis and dashboarding. It bridges the gap between raw data and immediate decision-making — ideal for showcasing data storytelling without complex code dependencies.
